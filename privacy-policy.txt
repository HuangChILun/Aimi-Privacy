================================================================================
⚠️ AGE RESTRICTION
================================================================================

By using Aimi, you confirm that you are 18 years of age or older. Aimi is not
intended for users under 18. We do not knowingly collect information from
individuals under 18 years of age. If you are under 18, you must not use this

================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

Welcome to Aimi. Aimi is operated by Chi-Lun Huang, who is the data controller
responsible for your personal information collected through this app. This
Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your
information when you use our mobile application ("App"). Please read this
privacy policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and
use of information in accordance with this policy.

================================================================================
1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
================================================================================

We collect several types of information to provide and improve our service:

1.1 ACCOUNT INFORMATION
- Google Account Data: When you sign in with Google, we collect:
  * Email address
  * Google User ID (unique identifier, also known as the "sub" claim in the
    ID token)

- Apple Account Data: When you sign in with Apple, we collect:
  * Email address (which may be Apple's private relay email if you choose
    "Hide My Email")
  * Apple User ID (unique identifier, also known as the "sub" claim in the
    ID token)

- Device Information: Platform type (iOS/Android), app version, device
  identifiers

- Push Notification Token (Optional): If you enable push notifications, we
  may collect your Expo Push Token to send you notifications about new
  messages, story updates, or important service announcements. This token is
  stored only if you grant notification permissions and can be removed by
  disabling notifications in your device settings.

1.2 USER PROFILE & PREFERENCES
- Language preference (English, Chinese, Japanese)
- Preferred communication tone and style
- Favorite topics and conversation taboos
- Addressing rules and interaction preferences

1.3 CHAT & CONVERSATION DATA
- Messages: All messages you send to AI characters and their responses
- Conversation History: Complete chat logs with timestamps
- Conversation Summaries: AI-generated summaries for context continuity
- Character Profiles: Custom characters you create (names, personalities,
  backstories, visual preferences)
- Story Progress: Progress in interactive visual novel stories, including
  choices made and save game data

1.4 VOICE & AUDIO DATA
- Voice Input (Processed by Platform Provider): When you use voice input, we
  use the expo-speech-recognition library which relies on native platform
  speech recognition APIs:

  * iOS: Your voice audio is processed by Apple's SFSpeechRecognizer service,
    which may transmit audio to Apple's servers for speech-to-text conversion

  * Android: Your voice audio is processed by Google's Speech Recognition
    service, which may transmit audio to Google's servers for speech-to-text
    conversion

  * On-Device Option: Both platforms support on-device recognition (if
    language packs are downloaded), which processes audio locally without
    server transmission

  * Aimi Backend: Your voice audio is NEVER sent to Aimi's backend servers.
    Only the resulting text message (after conversion by Apple/Google) is
    transmitted to our backend for AI processing

- Character Voice Audio (Generated): Character voice responses are generated
  using ElevenLabs voice synthesis service (via our backend). Only the text
  content of character responses is sent to ElevenLabs; your personal voice
  data is never shared with ElevenLabs

- Audio Cache: Generated character voice audio files are cached locally on
  your device for up to 7 days for performance optimization

🔒 PRIVACY NOTICE: Your voice audio is processed by Apple (iOS) or Google
(Android) speech recognition services, not by Aimi. Your voice recordings are
NEVER uploaded to Aimi's servers. Only the text output from Apple/Google's
speech recognition is transmitted to our backend for AI conversation
processing.

1.5 USAGE & ANALYTICS DATA
- Number of chat messages, voice synthesis, and portrait generation requests
- Feature usage patterns and interaction timestamps
- Session duration and frequency
- App performance metrics and error logs

1.6 SUBSCRIPTION & PAYMENT DATA
- Subscription Status: Current subscription plan (Free, Premium, etc.)
- Purchase History: Subscription purchases and upgrades (processed by Apple,
  Google, and RevenueCat)
- Entitlements: Features and quotas based on subscription
- Note: We do not store credit card or payment information

================================================================================

- AI Conversations: Process your text messages (including those converted from
  voice input by Apple/Google speech recognition) to generate contextually
  appropriate AI character responses

  text; we then receive the text and synthesize character voice responses
  using ElevenLabs

Purpose: Generate AI character responses to your messages
Provider: OpenAI API (accessed via our backend server)

Data Shared with OpenAI:
- Your chat messages (text only, converted from voice by Apple/Google if you
  use voice input)
- Character profiles and settings you've created
- Conversation context and history for continuity
- User preferences (language, tone, communication style)

Important Notes:
- Your voice audio is NOT shared: If you use voice input, your audio is
  processed by Apple (iOS) or Google (Android) and converted to text before
  reaching our servers. Only the text is sent to OpenAI

- Data retention by OpenAI: OpenAI may temporarily retain API request data
  (including your messages and conversation context) for up to 30 days for
  abuse detection and security purposes. Under certain legal requirements
  (such as court orders), this data may be retained for longer periods to
  comply with legal obligations

- Not used for AI training: According to OpenAI's API terms, data sent via
  API is not used to train their models unless you explicitly opt-in

Processing: All requests are proxied through our backend server; your personal
API credentials are never exposed
Privacy Policy: https://openai.com/privacy/

3.7 ELEVENLABS (Character Voice Synthesis)
Purpose: Convert AI-generated character response text into realistic voice
audio

Data Shared with ElevenLabs: AI-generated character response text (created by
the LLM) and voice ID selection for the character

Important Clarifications:
- NOT for user voice: ElevenLabs is used to create the character's voice, not
  to process your voice input

- Your voice is never sent to ElevenLabs: When you use voice input, it's
  processed by Apple/Google and converted to text. ElevenLabs only receives
  the AI's text response to synthesize the character's voice reply

- Text-to-Speech only: The flow is: AI generates text response → ElevenLabs
  converts that text to character voice audio → audio plays to you

Processing: All requests are proxied through our backend server
Privacy Policy: https://elevenlabs.io/privacy

3.8 BACKEND API SERVER

  specific legal requirement, credible safety concern, verified abuse report,
  or technical issue that requires investigation
